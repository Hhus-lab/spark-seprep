# Podman AI Lab

## Run an LLM powered application locally

Follow the directions from the Podman AI Lab documentation to [start a chatbot recipe](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/ai-lab/start-recipe).
You can choose any recipe from the `Recipe Catalog`. Many applications will use the same model downloaded in class,
`ibm-research/granite-3.2-8b-instruct-GGUF`. The `Codegen` recipe will by default use a model from HuggingFace that was fine-tuned
for code generation. The `Audio to Text` is a good option because the model is smaller. It's recommended to choose one of these options.

## Present your application

For our last class, each of you will show the class your model running with podman-desktop and the AI application
you chose. Why did you choose this `AI Lab Recipe`? Did you try others? Did it hallucinate? Tell us anything interesting you encountered while running
the AI application. If you ran into issues, tell us about them! How did you fix them or try to fix them?

No slideshow is needed, but you will be connecting your laptop to the projector to show us and the class your running (or failing) AI model.

The presentation should be 2 minutes or less. No other submission is needed!

This is graded, so if you don't come to class or present you will get 0 points for this assignment.

In previous semesters, the `Audio to Text` application was a popular choice.
All the best and have fun! Extra credit for those that try out some interesting applications!
